1. Presently, no API can indicate what an added object's new id is. The repository 
"add(Object)" function ought to return the new object, and this must be done for 
all of the APIs. 

2. All model objects must implement an addObject(Object) method that ensures that
a given reference cannot be placed in the Array of IDs more than once. This needs
to be tested by the model unit tests as well.

3. Presently it is not possible to move a Task from one TaskList to another.

4. Updates ought to have a clean-up method similar those present in Add APIs. It 
should update the repository with the serverObjects used to to map all of the
objects that need to be cleaned and modified.

5. Most unit tests do not test the point back error where an inconsistency in the 
database is not detected because the API assumes the internal data is never
corrupted.
